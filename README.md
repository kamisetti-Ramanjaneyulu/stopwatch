# stopwatch creating process
it contains two parts
1. animation
2.countdown(timer display)
#animation process:-
To create this animation process we need one main contain and four sub-containers.
main-container:- it main circular container it lies at the bottom.
four subcontainers:-
(three semi circular+ one circular container(width and height less then main container)
first semicircularcontainer:-it lies the top of the main container. if process is started it rotates upto 180degrees.
second semicircular container: it lies at the top of the first container . if process is started it rotates upto 360 degrees simultaniously with first semicircular container.
third semicircularcontainer: it lies the top of second circular container . it cover first one remaining half later it covers the first process.
fourth circular container: it lies on the top of the all container with less size.



next process:-
we convert time(ms) into angles. based on those angle we rotate the angle of above containers.
